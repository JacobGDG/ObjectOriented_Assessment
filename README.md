# ObjectOriented_Assessment

This project involved having 2 greyscale images stored as pgm or txt files. we used ImageJ to view them.

1: a shuffled image of the university of lincoln logo. We had to unscamble it by comparing it to a noisy unshuffled version of it.

2: a Where's Wally image in which we had to make tool to find the coordinates of wally from a seperate image we had of him.


We had to use a objective method to solve this problem. I essentially split the image up into smaller matrices and then compared the numerical values for each pixel to determine the differences between them.
