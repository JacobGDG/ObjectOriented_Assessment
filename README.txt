Writing this years after.
This project involved having 2 greyscale images stored as pgm or txt files. we used ImageJ to view them.
1: a shuffled image of the university of lincoln logo. We had to unscamble it by comparing it to a noisy unshuffled version of it.
2: We had a where's wally image inwhich we had to make tool to find the coordinates of wally from a seperate image we had of him.
